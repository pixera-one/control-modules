## Usage
There are two modified from the Timeline Builder.  
1. Added "Create Play Cue" to module properties.  
When enabled for "Create Play Cue", the play cue will be added to each resource when it is added to the timeline.  
Add 01 to 99 or A to Z in front the resource name to determine the order in which they are placed on the timeline.

2. Added "Fade Duration" action to the module.  
Set the time of the resource's fade duration by entering the number of seconds in "Fade Duration".
